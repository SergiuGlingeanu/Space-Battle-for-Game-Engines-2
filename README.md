# Space Battle for Game Engines 2
 
# Storyboard

Ender's Game.

I plan to make the space battle similar to the final battle from the movie. One side will have a few big ships, while the other side will have a lot of small ships.
I plan to make the camera follow the battle from a distant point to show the whole battle, sometimes showing the perspective from each faction as the battle progresses.

The smaller ships will use a swarming behaviour, while the big ships will try to destroy the planet and shoot down the smaller ships.
